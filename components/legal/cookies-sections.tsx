        Cookies are small text files that a website stores on your device when
        you visit it. They are widely used to make websites work efficiently,
        remember preferences, and provide information to the site owner. We
        also use similar technologies such as pixels, local storage, and web
        beacons. For simplicity we refer to all of these as
        &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;.

          <li><strong>Browser settings</strong> — most browsers let you accept, reject, or delete cookies, either entirely or per site.</li>
          <li><strong>Cookie controls on our site</strong> — where offered, our cookie banner lets you choose which non-essential categories to allow.</li>
          <li><strong>Device controls</strong> — mobile operating systems offer their own ad-tracking and analytics controls.</li>
