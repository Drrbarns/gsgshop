          We collect information you provide directly, information generated as
          you use the Services, and limited information from carefully selected
          third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>Identity &amp; contact information</h3>
        <p>
          Name, photo or avatar, gender (where you provide it), date of birth
          (where required), phone number, email address, delivery address,
          billing address, and alternative contacts.
        </p>

        <h3>Account &amp; verification information</h3>
        <p>
          Username, password (stored as a salted hash), verification documents
          where required by law (for example, for higher-value escrow
          transactions or affiliate payouts), and tax identification numbers
          where applicable.
        </p>

        <h3>Transaction information</h3>
        <p>
          Items ordered, sourcing requests, courier waybills, escrow contracts,
          fees paid, mobile-money references, card BIN data (we do not store
          full card numbers — these are tokenised by our payment partners),
          refunds, and chargeback records.
        </p>

        <h3>Communications information</h3>
        <p>
          Messages you send us via WhatsApp, Telegram, email, phone, and in-app
          forms, plus call recordings where lawful and disclosed at the start
          of the call.
        </p>

        <h3>Device, log &amp; usage information</h3>

          IP address, device type, operating system, browser type, language,
          referring URLs, pages visited, click paths, error logs, and
          approximate location based on IP. See our Cookie Policy for
          cookie-specific information.
        </p>

        <h3>Location information</h3>
        <p>
          Where you provide it (for example, an address you ask us to deliver
          to, or a live pin shared during a courier handover).
        </p>

        <h3>Sensitive information</h3>
        <p>
          We do not seek to collect sensitive personal information (such as
          health, religion, political views, or ethnic origin). Where context
          requires it (for example, dietary needs for StreetCuisine or a
          community-support enrolment for GSG-AID), we collect only what is
          necessary and with your explicit consent.
