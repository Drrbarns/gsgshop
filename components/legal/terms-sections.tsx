          order.

          We make every effort to keep listings accurate, but errors in

          the order.

          Sell-Safe Buy-Safe is a protection service that holds payment from a
          buyer until the seller delivers the agreed goods or service. Both
          parties must agree to specific, written conditions — item
          description, price, delivery timeline, return rules — before funds
          are held.
        </p>
        <p>
          Funds are released to the seller once the buyer confirms receipt and
          inspection within the agreed timeframe, or after that timeframe has
          elapsed without a valid dispute being raised.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where a dispute is raised, GSG Brands acts as a neutral facilitator.
          We may request supporting documents, photos, or videos and may
          consult independent expertise. Our decision in a dispute is final
          between you and GSG, without prejudice to your other legal rights.

          Sell-Safe Buy-Safe is not insurance and does not guarantee against all
          losses, including those arising from misrepresentation outside the
          agreed terms, force majeure events, or claims raised after the agreed
          inspection window.
